# Adding Comments (Form)
---

At this point you should have a functioning site that creates and saves Reviews to a database! This system manages a *single resource*, which we've called a `Review`. In this section you will add a new resource which will represent comments that visitors can add to Reviews.

Comments will be treated like Reviews: they will have a model that defines them, and they will be stored as documents in the database.

# Create a partial for the comment form

Follow the same approach used in the tutorial, start with what users will see. Users reading a Review may want to write a comment and read comments posted by other users. Adding comments will require a form to enter the comment.

Putting the comment form in a partial will make your code modular and help keep it organized.

> Make a new file `views/partials/comment-form.handlebars`:

```HTML
<!-- views/partials/comment-form.handlebars -->

<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Add a Comment</legend>
    <!-- TITLE -->
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="comment-title">Title</label><br>
      <input class="form-control"
        id="comment-title"
        type="text"
        name="title"
        placeholder="Title"/>
    </div>

    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="comment-content">Description</label><br>
      <textarea class="form-control"
      id="comment-content"
      name="content"
      rows="10"
      placeholder="Your comment..."/></textarea>
    </div>
  </fieldset>

  <!-- BUTTON -->
  <div class="form-group">
    <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Save Comment</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

Notice you used the same class names and markup used in the Reviews Form. This form only has three form elements:

1. One input for the title of the comment
1. A text area for the content of the comment
1. A button to submit the form.

# Display the Comment

> Add the partial to the bottom of `views/review-show.handlebars`.

```HTML
<!-- views/reviews-show.handlebars -->

<a href="/">Back to Home</a>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
    <h1>{{review.title}}</h1>
    <h2>{{review.movieTitle}}</h2>
    <p>{{review.description}}</p>
    <p><a href="/reviews/{{review._id}}/edit">Edit</a></p>
    <p><form method="POST" action="/reviews/{{review._id}}?_method=DELETE">
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Delete</button>
    </form></p>

    <hr>

    <!-- Comment form -->
    {{> comment-form}}

  </div>
</div>
```

For now the form action is empty. You should be able to see the form but, nothing will happen if you click submit. We need to add a route for that! We'll do that next, but let's commit what we have so far.

# Now Commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Comment form added'
$ git push
```
